SouvenirBooth was developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.4

You require an external tool to take pictures from a camera.
To integrate this tool, write a subclass of ch.codez.souvenirbooth.util.CameraAdapter
Currently, adapters for
isightcapture (http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/27190) and
gphoto2 (www.gphoto.org) 
are already available.

Configuration of motives and backgrounds happens in the file motives.xml. 
The number of motives and backgrounds in not limited.

Configuration of general properties happens in the file souvenirbooth.properties.

On Mac OS X with the gphoto2 adapter, you have to run the killptp.sh script 
after connecting a camera and before running SouvenirBooth.

And now have fun already :)
